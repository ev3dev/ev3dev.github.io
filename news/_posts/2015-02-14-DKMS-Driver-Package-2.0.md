title: DKMS Driver Package 2.0
---

In case you didn't know, you can actually use ev3dev drivers on anything
that runs Linux, not just the EV3 itself! Right now, this is just limited
to the WeDo USB Hub and EV3/UART sensors. Find out more about it
[here](https://github.com/ev3dev/lego-linux-drivers-dkms) and
[here](http://lechnology.com/2014/09/using-uart-sensors-on-any-linux/).

This release gets the DKMS package updated using the same drivers as the
`3.16.7-ckt4-ev3dev1` kernel.
