title: "Raspberry Pi 2 Image Release"
---

You can now install ev3dev on your Raspberry Pi 2 and use it with your [Dexter
Industries BrickPi]. This image has all of the same packages as the Rapsberry
Pi 1 image, but it uses the official Debian armhf packages instead of the
Raspbian packages for Raspberry Pi 1.

Here is the [download] and the [release notes].
