This image release contains updated packages from the previous
ev3dev-jessie-2015-05-20 release, including packages from the Debian 8.1 point
release and a new [ev3dev kernel].

[Download] and [release notes].

Note: If you have already installed the ev3dev-jessie-2015-05-01 or newer release, you
don't need to install this new release.
`sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
is (hopefully) sufficient to get all of the changes. If you have an older release,
you need to install a new image because of some [major changes].
