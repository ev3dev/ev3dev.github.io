This image release contains updated packages from the previous
release, including packages from the Debian 8.1 and 8.2 point
releases and a new [ev3dev kernel] \(v4.1.7-7-ev3dev-rpi).

[Download] and [release notes].

Note: If you have already installed a previous rpi image, you
don't need to install this new release.
`sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
is (hopefully) sufficient to get all of the changes.
