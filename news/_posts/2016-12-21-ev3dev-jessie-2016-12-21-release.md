Just in time for those of you that might be getting an EV3 for Christmas...

### What's New?

There is not much new in this release. And that is a good thing. It means that
ev3dev-jessie is pretty much stable now and we promise to try not to break things.

There are of course a few changes though. There are some updated packages and an
updated kernel with some bug fixes. There is also a new `python3-rpyc` package.
More details are in the [release notes].
