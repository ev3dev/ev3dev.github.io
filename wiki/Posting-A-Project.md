title: Posting A Project
index: wiki

We maintain a list of projects that use ev3dev on the website at [www.ev3dev.org/projects](http://www.ev3dev.org/projects). Each project gets a dedicated page for the author to explain what they have been working on, as well as provide videos, pictures, build instructions, code, and any other media that pertains to the project. This is where we explain how you can submit your project page to be hosted on the site.

##Overview
All the posts on the website are stored in the [posts folder](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io/tree/master/_posts). Each post is saved as a Markdown file, and is automagically converted to HTML when you publish your changes (read more about Markdown [here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics)). To submit a page, all you need to do is add a markdown file in that folder and submit a pull request. We recommend that you start with a copy of the [template project](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2014-03-21-Example-Project.md). You can see the example file live on [the website](http://www.ev3dev.org/projects/2014/03/21/Example-Project/).

This guide will walk you through submitting a page without the need for any git experience or local tools installed on your computer. All you need is a browser.

##Step 1: Making a Copy of the Website Source
The first step to submitting your project is forking the source code on GitHub. To do this, open a browser and navigate to the [website repository](http://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io). Make sure that you are signed in to your GitHub account, and then click the "fork" button in the upper-right corner.

It should take a second, but when GitHub finishes processing your request you should be at a page very similar to where you started, except now you are looking at your own copy.

##Step 2: Setting Up A Preview (Optional)
If you want to be able to preview your new page before you submit it, and are willing to add a bit of extra complexity, you have to create a new branch called `gh-pages`. Adding this branch will let you preview the whole site, so you can see how your page will look when it is published (which is different from the markdown preview that you will see on GitHub). To do this, click the box where it says "branch: master". It should expand to show you a text box. Type the text `gh-pages` in to the box that appears (make sure that it is exactly that text; this is important). It should give you the option to create a new branch; click that button.

Now, you should be able to navigate to `http://<username>.github.io/ev3dev.github.io` in a new tab to see your copy of the site. After you complete step 3, visit this preview URL again to make sure that your page looks as it should.

If you complete this step, note that everywhere it says "`master`" in the screenshots below, it should say "`gh-pages`" instead.

*WARNING*: If you complete this step, GitHub will send you emails warning you about the CNAME. You can ignore them; but if they get annoying, see [the readme](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io) on the official site repo for information on circumventing the problem.

##Step 3: Adding Your Page
Now that you have your own copy the site, it's time to create your page. To start, use the file list and choose the `_posts` folder. Select the file called `2014-03-21-Example-Project.md` to open it in the browser.

GitHub will try to read the file and render it how it thinks it's intended to be displayed. Although the preview that it shows you probably won't look exactly like it will on the site, it should give you a pretty good idea.

Click the "Raw" button in the upper-right corner of the page to view the contents of the file itself.

This file that you have opened is not an actual project. It is a template file that is meant to be copied to make new project creation easier. The part we want is everything between the "---"s. This is called "frontmatter," and it describes everything about a project, such as the author of the project. Select and copy the frontmatter out of the template file (make sure that you include the dashes). This is what you should have:

```
    ---
    # Fill out as many of these as you can, and delete the rest.
    author: [ "@wasabifan", "The ev3dev Team" ] # The person(s) who created this project. 
    # Any author that starts with "@" will pull information from github.
    programming_language: "JavaScript" # The programming language used in this project

    youtube_video_id: rrNaLfE9PWA # The video ID of the YouTube video to be displayed with this post

    project_homepage_url: "http://example.com/my-super-cool-project" # Homepage for this project
    source_code_url: "https://github.com/myuser/myrepo" # Provide a link to your code
    building_instructions_url: "http://example.com/building-instructions.pdf"
    ---
```

Now use the "back" button of your browser to go back to the posts folder. Click the "+" button to create a new file.

Give it a name using the format "`YYYY-MM-DD-my-project-name.md`", where `YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` are the current year, month, and day, and `my-project-name` is the name of your project, with dashes instead of spaces. Then paste in the frontmatter that we copied earlier. Fill out as many of the properties as you can, and delete the lines of the ones you can't fill out. After the second set of dashes ('---'), you can type your description text, which is parsed as [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) on the site.

Once you are happy with the content of your new page, click the "Commit new file" button to save your changes. This is when you should go and preview your page if you created a `gh-pages` branch earlier. 


##Step 4: Submitting Your Changes
Now that you have made your changes to your copy of the site, you need to submit your changes for review.

Open a browser and navigate back to `https://github.com/<username>/ev3dev.github.io`.
    
If you followed step 3, you will need to switch to the `gh-pages` branch that you created earlier using the same box in the upper-left corner. Click it and select "gh-pages."

Now click the green "Compare, review and pull request" button.

<img src="https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/pull_requests/pull-request-start-review-button.png" style="max-width: 300px;" />

Then click "Create pull request," and enter a title and brief description of your new page before clicking the button that says "Create pull request" again to submit your changes.

The project maintainers will be notified automatically that you have submitted edits, and will review and merge your changes when they get the chance.
