Sioux .NET on Track is one of the expertisegroups of Sioux Technologies in Eindhoven (The Netherlands).

We are a group of enthusiastic software engineers who come together after working hours to get experience with Microsoft.NET.
To make learning fun, we develop an application in C# for making a fully automated Lego train using Lego Mindstorms EV3.
The bricks are currently programmed using the default Lego programming environment, but because this programming is rather odd,
we are now moving to the EV3DEV environment. For this environment, we choose C++ as programming language.
