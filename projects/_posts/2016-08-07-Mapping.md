## Overview

A 2D/3D mapping/scanning project consisting off:

- robot side code 
- cross-platform visualization 

Robot side code is really a bunch of super-simple programs which I call modules.
Each of those programs works perfectly well from the command line without the rest of the project.
The sole exception is ev3control module which enables/disables/monitors other modules.
The repository for robot side code is [ev3dev-mapping-modules].

The cross-platform visualization is a [Unity] project that can plot the readings in real-time and/or control the robot.
Like other projects written in Unity it works on more than 10 [platforms], in theory at least. 
Unity has also a nice abstraction for input so robots can be controlled with keyboards/pads/mice/wheels/mobiles and so on.
The repository for cross-platform visualization is [ev3dev-mapping-ui].

I try to keep the budget of the project low, around 400$ (360€) including EV3 and motors.

The meta-repository of the project is [ev3dev-mapping].

This is my personal project. While I am quite happy to share the results, please keep in mind that I am pursuing my own goals here.

## Examples

The examples are X3D models. 


**_You can interact with the scenes with your mouse and keyboard:_**

- rotation with LMB
- rotation point selection with double LMB
- pan with ctrl (command) key + LMB
- zoom with the wheel or alt + LMB or RMB
- reset the view with 'r' key

{% include x3d-model.html caption="Example Phase II raw scan" source="/images/projects/2016-08-07-Mapping/csi-body.x3d" %}

{% include x3d-model.html caption="Example Phase II result + MeshLab surface reconstruction" source="/images/projects/2016-08-07-Mapping/face-reconstruction.x3d" %}

The technology behind the 3d models is [x3dom]. It is supported in up-to-date Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge and other browsers with at least [WebGL] support.

## Phase I

Goals:

1. Hardware selection
-  CruizCore XG1300L gyroscope for low bias drift and great accuracy
-  XV11 Lidar for unmatched... price 
2. Drivers
-  CruizCore XG1300L driver on top of wonderful @dlech sensor driver framework
-  XV11 Lidar in userspace using extensive information from [xv11hacking]
3. Correct geometry
-  nobody (on the internet) seems to treat XV11 [rotational geometry] correctly
4. LIDAR standard deviation
-  evaluation with respect to distance
5. Experimental 2D mapping
-  experimental code to learn and throw away

The Phase I is finished with results:

-   [Using the XV11 Lidar tutorial]
-   [xv11lidar] C/C++ library
-   [mi-xg1300l] CruizCore XG1300L driver 
-   [ev3dev-mapping-abandoned] repository

## Phase II

Goals:

1. Cross-platform visualisation/computation/control
-   [Unity] chosen for amazing [platforms] support
2. Modular architecture design
-   modules as simple command line programs in any language
-   supervisor on top that does 'magic'
-   UI components counterpart of modules 
3. 3D mapping with lidars in arbitrary position/rotation
-   XY and XZ plane support with any position, generalizing is easy
4. Mapping in movement
-   precise per reading interpolation for position/heading
5. Support for hundreds of thousands of points on average laptop
-   lidar spits around 100k points a minute!
6. Network communication recording/replaying
-   for running same data with different algorithms/parameters added features
-   for reprocessing the data on more powerful machine if needed
-   for near-perfect path repeating
7. Data export to widely-accepted file format
-   [ply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)) chosen for ease of implementation
8. Multiple lidars support at the same time
-   just use multiple Laser components
9. Multiple robots support at the same time
-   no problem but drive (keyboard, pad) scripted for single robot now
10. Extensibility for different hardware
-   this needs writing own modules/components

Phase II is functionally finished now with results:

-    [ev3dev-mapping-ui] Unity project repository
-    [ev3dev-mapping-modules] robot modules repository
-    [ev3dev-mapping-ui-udp] recorded UDP communication from some mappings
-    [ev3dev-mapping-results] with screenshots/3D models/pipelines

The Phase II robot in action:

-    [3D mapping/scanning project with ev3dev OS and Unity UI]

## State of the Project 

Information from 10 Aug. 2016.

Phase II is functionally finished. I am tidying up the code. It will take some time:
 
-    ev3control & Control are rewritten for TCP/IP, UDP is working but not suitable for that
-    Unity component model is reworked from flat structure to hierarchical structure (robot with child subsystems instead of with all components)
-    common properties are moved to separate components (e.g. Network Configuration component)
-    component dependencies are reworked (e.g. Laser, LaserRenderer, LaserUI components instead of Laser with nested renderer, and ui prefabs)
-    UI needs some work but I am rather leaning towards built-in console

Phase III is in plans but I need a break now.

## Architecture

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/projects/2016-08-07-Mapping/architecture-phaseII.png" caption="Phase II software architecture" %}

The `odometry module` sends timestamped position and heading data to the `odometry component`. Position and heading are reflected in the UI.
The data is kept in `position history` component in circular buffer.

The `laser module` sends timestamped data to the `laser component`. The `laser component` grabs position snapshots in required timeframe from the `position history` component.
The position and heading data is interpolated individually for each laser reading. Once the data is ready it is reflected in the UI.

The `drive component` translates input from the user (keyboard, pad, numerical, ...) using the motion model and sends it to the `drive module`.
The `drive module` controls the motors.

The `control component` and the `control module` are not in the scheme for clarity. The `control component` sends to `control module` requests to enable/disable modules.
The `control module` replies with module states. 
 
## Building Instructions

[Using the XV11 Lidar tutorial] has information on electrical/mechanical XV11 Lidar interfacing.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/projects/2016-08-07-Mapping/robot-phaseII.jpg" caption="Hardware used for testing in Phase II" %}

Phase II key parts:

-    2 large EV3 motors (95658)
-    caster wheel (99948 + 92911)
-    MicroInfinity CruizCore gyroscope, see [mi-xg1300l]
-    2 lidars ripped off Neato, see [Using the XV11 Lidar tutorial] 
-    [MinuteBot] technic baseplate

One XY-plane lidar is enough for 3D scanning. The XZ-plane lidar is for orientation 
and Phase III project.

## Working with 3D data

[MeshLab] is a great UI tool for post-processing point clouds exported from [ev3dev-mapping-ui]. 
Its functionality includes normals calculation, surface reconstruction
 and export to [u3d] (for 3d pdfs), [x3d] (for 3d on the web) and other common 3d formats.
 
[AOPT] is a great command-line tool for optimizing x3d models for the web. It is part of [InstantReality] virtual/augmented reality framework.
One way to share x3d content on the web is using [x3dom] which is supporting implementation in ongoing [Web3d] and [W3C] discussion on declarative 3d content in html.

For example pipelines used for post-processing [ev3dev-mapping-ui] data see [ev3dev-mapping-results].
