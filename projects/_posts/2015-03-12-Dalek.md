The [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) are evil aliens from [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who), and are the Doctor's most fearsome enemy. Inside the armoured shell is an alien creature that wants nothing less than to exterminate all non-Dalek life in the universe.

This Dalek is still a work in progress. At the moment, it must be remote-controlled from a PC over WiFi, and can't do anything on its own yet. It can move, turn its head, speak, and take photos with its webcam eye.

The next steps are to build the creature inside it, and add an infrared sensor (without spoiling the look of it) so it can start to do things on its own.
