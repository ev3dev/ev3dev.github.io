This is a robot that can catch a ball thrown at it.
It is a [delta robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_robot) with a grabber on the end effector.
This design allows the robot to move the grabber with the speed and precision necessary to catch a ball flying through the air.

It uses two [NXTcam](http://www.mindsensors.com/ev3-and-nxt/14-vision-subsystem-camera-for-nxt-or-ev3-nxtcam-v4) cameras to allow it to estimate the trajectory of the ball in 3D.
For more information about how this works, see [this post](http://www.dsharlet.com/2016/09/11/estimating-the-3d-trajectory-of-a-flying-object-from-2d-observations/)

Most HTML will work too.

Here are some suggestions for what to include in your description:

- **Your name:** Who are you?
- **Location:** Where do you live? At least, which country. City would be nice too.
- **Pictures and media:** If you don't have any video, do you have pictures? Or maybe a PDF detailing what you built?
- **Feedback:** Is there a place that people can leave comments or ask questions? Maybe on your GitHub repo or on your blog?
