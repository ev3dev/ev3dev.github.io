Congkak robot is a robot that plays Congkak, a South-East Asian board game. There are two sets of seven holes plus an additional big hole at the end of each side called house. Players start by scooping balls from one of the hole from their side and distributing one ball at each consecutive hole except for the opponentâ€™s house hole, in a clockwise manner. Players with the most number of balls in their house hole wins.

The robot has infrared sensors to detect which hole the player chose and does its calculation to predict the position of all the balls in each hole at every instant.
