## Overview

This project has two diffent parts:

  - ev3dev_ros_distribution
  - ev3_wiimote

## ev3dev_ros_distribution

Create a Robot Operating System (ROS) Jade distribution installed in an ev3dev image [ev3dev_ros_distribution](https://github.com/osmado/ev3dev_ros_distribution).
This project describes how to create a docker container that includes ev3dev and ROS. It also explains how to use the Docker image to compile ROS software.
  
## ev3_wiimote

ROS node to drive a Lego robot from a wiimote controller [ev3_wiimote](https://github.com/osmado/ev3_wiimote).
This example project combines ROS and wiimote (libcwiid). It is only a basic functionality project (turn right, turn left and go ahead).
