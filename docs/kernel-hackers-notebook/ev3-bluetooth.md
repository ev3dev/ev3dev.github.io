title: EV3 Bluetooth
---

The EV3 uses a Panasonic PAN1325(A) bluetooth module with a Texas
Instruments chip. It is Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR.

Early models have Panasonic part number ENW8918A2JF with TI part number CC2560.

Staring around July 2015, EV3s started shipping Panasonic part number
ENW8929A2KF with TI part number CC2560A instead.

## Notes

* Starting around July 2015, LEGO started shipping EV3s with a different Bluetooth
  chip. (Running `hciconfig -a` indicates that the newer chips are BT 4.0, but
  they don't actually support BTLE).
* We use the same Bluetooth firmware files that are included in the official LEGO EV3 firmware.
  They are packaged in [firmware-ev3](https://github.com/ev3dev/firmware-ev3).
* Communicates with the CPU via UART2
* Requires a 32.767MHz "slow clock". This is generated by ECAP2 (in APWM mode).
