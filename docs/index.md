If there's a topic that you think we should have docs for, please
consider [contributing](../contribute).

[Some pages](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/153#issuecomment-93602107)
have not been migrated from our old wiki yet. We'd love some help
with getting these last few pages migrated! If you would like to
help out, read more about what's needed in the
[documentation section](../contribute#write-some-documentation)
of our "contributing" page.

## Installation and setup

If you're looking to set up a new installation of ev3dev, check out
our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.


## Tutorials

We have a page of tutorials which cover a wide range of topics, from
networking to specialized hardware configuration. Head over to our
[Tutorials page](/docs/tutorials) to see the full list.


## Writing some software

To take advantage of ev3dev's main functionality, you'll probably want to
use a pre-built library from [our central list of programming languages with
supported libraries](/docs/programming-languages). Choose a language to
get started!


## Platform Comparison

[Compare all of the hardware platforms supported by ev3dev.](platform-comparison)


## Hardware drivers

If you need to directly program against the ev3dev driver APIs, you can
check out our [hardware driver documentation](/docs/driver-overview).


## Developing the ev3dev kernel

In an effort to make it as easy as possible for community members to help out with core software
development, we have assembled a [kernel hacker's notebook](kernel-hackers-notebook)
that contains information about the EV3 hardware, important devices, and the operating system itself.
If you are interested in working with the ev3dev source code, you'll also need to know how to
use our set of [ev3dev Developer Tools](devtools).
