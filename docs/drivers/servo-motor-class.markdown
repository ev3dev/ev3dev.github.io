title: Servo Motor Class
---

The `servo-motor` class provides a uniform interface for using [hobby type
servo motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_%28radio_control%29).

### sysfs Attributes

Servo motors can be found at `/sys/class/servo-motor/motor<N>`, where `<N>`
is incremented each time a servo is loaded (it is not related to which port
the motor is plugged in to).

`command` (write-only)
: Sets the command for the servo. Valid values are `run` and `float`. Setting
to `run` will cause the servo to be driven to the position_sp set in the
`position_sp` attribute. Setting to `float` will remove power from the motor.

`driver_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the motor driver that loaded this device. See the list
of [supported devices] for a list of drivers.

`max_pulse_sp` (read/write)
: Used to set the pulse size in milliseconds for the signal that tells the
servo to drive to the maximum (clockwise) position_sp. Default value is 2400.
Valid values are 2300 to 2700. You must write to the position_sp attribute for
changes to this attribute to take effect.

`mid_pulse_sp` (read/write)
: Used to set the pulse size in milliseconds for the signal that tells the
servo to drive to the mid position_sp. Default value is 1500. Valid
values are 1300 to 1700. For example, on a 180 degree servo, this would be
90 degrees. On continuous rotation servo, this is the "neutral" position_sp
where the motor does not turn. You must write to the position_sp attribute for
changes to this attribute to take effect.

`min_pulse_sp` (read/write)
: Used to set the pulse size in milliseconds for the signal that tells the
servo to drive to the miniumum (counter-clockwise) position_sp. Default value
is 600. Valid values are 300 to 700. You must write to the position_sp
attribute for changes to this attribute to take effect.

`polarity` (read/write)
: Sets the polarity of the servo. Valid values are `normal` and `inversed`.
Setting the value to `inversed` will cause the position_sp value to be
inversed. i.e `-100` will correspond to `max_pulse_sp`, and `100` will
correspond to `min_pulse_sp`.

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port that the motor is connected to.

`position_sp` (read/write)
: Reading returns the current position_sp of the servo. Writing instructs the
servo to move to the specified position_sp. Units are percent. Valid values
are -100 to 100 (-100% to 100%) where `-100` corresponds to `min_pulse_sp`,
`0` corresponds to `mid_pulse_sp` and `100` corresponds to `max_pulse_sp`.

`rate_sp` (read/write)
: Sets the rate_sp at which the servo travels from 0 to 100.0% (half of the full
range of the servo). Units are in milliseconds. Example: Setting the rate_sp
to 1000 means that it will take a 180 degree servo 2 second to move from 0
to 180 degrees. Note: Some servo controllers may not support this in which
case reading and writing will fail with `-EOPNOTSUPP`. In continuous rotation
servos, this value will affect the rate_sp at which the speed ramps up or down.

`state` (read-only)
: Returns a space separated list of flags indicating the state of the servo.
Possible flag is `running` - indicates that the motor is powered.
