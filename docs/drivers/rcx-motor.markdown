title: RCX/Power Functions Motor Driver
---

This driver provides a [dc-motor] interface for RCX motors, Power Functions
motors or any other 9V rated DC motor connected to an output port. You can
find the devices bound to this driver in the directory
`/sys/bus/lego/drivers/rcx-motor`. There is not much of interest there
though - all the useful stuff is in the [dc-motor] class.

This device is loaded when an [legoev3-output-port] is set to `rcx-motor`
mode. It is not automatically detected.
