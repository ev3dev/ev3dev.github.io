title: EV3 UART Sensor Line Discipline
---

This driver is a tty [line discipline] that runs on top of a tty. It listens
for the information data that is sent from EV3/UART sensors. When it receives
valid data, it negotiates with the sensor, telling the sensor to enter data
sending mode. After successful negotiation, it creates an [lego-sensor class]
that is used to monitor and control the sensor.

This line discipline has been assigned the number 29. To attach this line
discipline to a tty, run `ldattach 29 /dev/tty<N>` where `<N>` is the name
of the tty you want to connect to.  **NOTE:** This driver [works with any
tty], which means the sensor does not necessarily have to be plugged into
one of the input ports on the EV3.

EV3/UART sensors do not require individual drivers like other types of
sensors. Instead, all of the needed info to sent from the sensor in a common
format.  As a result, the name returned by the [lego-sensor][lego-sensor
class] `driver_name` attribute may not be a real driver name. For well-known
sensors (the LEGO EV3 sensors) it will return a name like `lego-ev3-color`.
For unknown sensors it returns `ev3-uart-<N>`, where `<N>` is the type id
of the sensor.
