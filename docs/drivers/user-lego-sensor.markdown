title: User-defined LEGO sensor devices
---

The `user-lego-sensor` class provides an interface for implementing user-defined
sensors in userspace.

### Identifying sensors

Since the name of the `sensor<N>` device node does not correspond to the port
that a sensor is plugged in to, you must look at the `address` attribute if
you need to know which port a sensor is plugged in to. This will match the
`address` of the corresponding sensor in the `lego-sensor` class.

### sysfs Attributes

Sensors can be found at `/sys/class/user-lego-sensor/sensor<N>`, where `<N>`
is incremented each time a sensor is loaded (it is not related to which port
the sensor is plugged in to).

`bin_data`
: (write-only) Writing stores the data which can be read using the
`bin_data` and `value<N>` attributes in the corresponding `lego-sensor`
class device.

`text_value`
: (write-only) Writing stores the value which can be read using the
`text_value` attribute in the corresponding `lego-sensor` class device.
It is currently limited to 512 bytes in length.
