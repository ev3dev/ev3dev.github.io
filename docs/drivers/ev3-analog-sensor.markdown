title: EV3 Analog Sensor Driver
---

The `ev3-analog-sensor` module provides all of the drivers for EV3/Analog
sensors. You can find the complete list [here][supported sensors].

### sysfs

You can find all of the the devices bound to this driver in the directory
`/sys/bus/lego/drivers/ev3-analog-sensor/`. However, these drivers provide a
[lego-sensor class] device, which is where all the really useful attributes
are.

[supported sensors]: ../#supported-sensors
