title: NXT I2C Sensor Driver
---

The `nxt-i2c-sensor` module provides all of the drivers for NXT/I2C
sensors. You can find the complete list [here][supported sensors].

### Module Parameters

Note: These parameters can be changed at runtime at
`/sys/module/nxt_i2c_sensor/parameters/<parameter>`.

`allow_autodetect`
: Setting to `N` disables probing of sensors. Default is `Y`.

`default_poll_ms`
: This provides the default value for the poll_ms attribute. A value of `0`
    will disable polling by default. Values of less that the minimum 50
    msec will be rounded up to 50 msec. Changes only affect sensors plugged
    in after the change was made. Default is 100 msec.

### sysfs

You can find devices bound to this driver in the directory
`/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/nxt-i2c-sensor/`. However, these drivers provide a
[lego-sensor device], which is where all the really useful attributes are.
