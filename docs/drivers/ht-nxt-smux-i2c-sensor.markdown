title: HiTechnic NXT Sensor Multiplexer I2C sensor driver
---

A `ht-smux-i2c-sensor` device is loaded by the [ht-nxt-smux] driver
when it is detected by the sensor mux (automatic detection only works with
the sensors listed in the linked page) or when manually specified by setting
the [ht-nxt-smux-port] to `i2c` mode and writing the device name to
`set_device`. You can use any one of the sensors that has the `nxt-i2c-sensor`
module from the [list of supported sensors]. Keep in mind though that the
sensor mux operates in a read-only mode with I2C sensors. You will not be
able to use commands with these sensors. Additionally, some modes of I2C
sensors require writing data to the sensor and as a result, these modes will
not be usable either.

### sysfs attributes

Devices bound to this driver can be found in the directory
`/sys/bus/lego/drivers/ht-nxt-smux-i2c-sensor/`. However, these sensors use
the [lego-sensor class] which is where the useful stuff is. Follow the link
for more information.
