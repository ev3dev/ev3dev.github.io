title: RCX/Power Functions LED Driver
---

This driver provides a [leds] interface for RCX motors, Power Functions
motors or any other 9V rated LED connected to an output port. You can find
the sysfs device at `/sys/bus/lego/devices/<port>:rcx-led` where `<port>`
is the the name of the output port the motor is connected to (e.g. `outA`).
There is not much of interest there though - all the useful stuff is in the
[leds] class.

This device is loaded when an [ev3-output-port] is set to `led` mode.
It is not automatically detected.
