title: Tacho Motor Class
---

The `tacho-motor` class provides a uniform interface for using motors with
positional and directional feedback such as the EV3 and NXT motors. This
feedback allows for precise control of the motors.

### sysfs Attributes

Tacho motors can be found at `/sys/class/tacho-motor/motor<N>`, where `<N>`
is incremented each time a motor is loaded (it is not related to which port
the motor is plugged in to).

`address`
: (read-only) Returns the name of the port that the motor is connected to.

`command`
: (write-only) Sends a command to the motor controller. Possible values are:

    - `run-forever`: Causes the motor to run until another command is sent.
    - `run-to-abs-pos`: Runs the motor to an absolute position specified by
      `position_sp` and then stops the motor using the command specified in
      `stop_action`.
    - `run-to-rel-pos`: Runs the motor to a position relative to the current
      `position` value. The new position will be current `position` +
      `position_sp`. When the new position is reached, the motor will stop
       using the command specified by `stop_action`.
    - `run-timed`: Run the motor for the amount of time specified in
      `time_sp` and then stops the motor using the command specified by
      `stop_action`.
    - `run-direct`: Runs the motor using the duty cycle specified by
      `duty_cycle_sp`. Unlike other run commands, changing `duty_cycle_sp`
       while running *will* take effect immediately.
    - `stop`: Stop any of the run commands before they are complete using
      the command specified by `stop_action`.
    - `reset`: Resets all of the motor parameter attributes to their default
       values. This will also have the effect of stopping the motor.

    Not all commands may be supported. Read the `commands` attribute to get
    the list of commands supported by a particular driver.

`commands`
: (read-only) Returns a space separated list of commands that are supported
by the motor controller.

`count_per_rot`
: (read-only) Returns the number of tacho counts in one rotation of the
motor. Tacho counts are used by the position and speed attributes, so you
can use this value to convert from rotations or degrees to tacho counts.
(rotation motors only)

`count_per_m`
: (read-only) Returns the number of tacho counts in one meter of travel
of the motor. Tacho counts are used by the position and speed
attributes, so you can use this value to convert from distance to tacho
counts. (linear motors only)

`full_travel_count`
: (read-only) Returns the number of tacho counts in the full travel of
the motor. When combined with the `count_per_m` atribute, you can use
this value to calculate the maximum travel distance of the motor.
(linear motors only)

`driver_name`
: (read-only) Returns the name of the driver that provides this tacho motor
device.

`duty_cycle`
: (read-only) Returns the current duty cycle of the motor. Units are percent.
Values are -100 to 100.

`duty_cycle_sp`
: (read/write) Writing sets the duty cycle setpoint. Reading returns the
current value. Units are in percent. Valid values are -100 to 100. A
negative value causes the motor to rotate in reverse.

`polarity`
: (read/write) Sets the polarity of the motor. Valid values are:

    - `normal`: A positive duty cycle will cause the motor to rotate
      clockwise.
    - `inversed`: A positive duty cycle will cause the motor to rotate
       counter-clockwise.

`position`
: (read/write) Returns the current position of the motor in pulses of the
rotary encoder. When the motor rotates clockwise, the position will
increase. Likewise, rotating counter-clockwise causes the position to
decrease. Writing will set the position to that value. The range is
-2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,647 tachometer counts (32-bit signed integer).

`hold_pid/Kd`
: (read/write) The derivative constant for the position PID.

`hold_pid/Ki`
: (read/write) The integral constant for the position PID.

`hold_pid/Kp`
: (read/write) The proportional constant for the position PID.

`max_speed`
: (read) Returns the maximum value that is accepted by the `speed_sp`
attribute. This may be slightly different than the maximum speed that
a particular motor can reach - it's the maximum theoretical speed.

`position_sp`
: (read/write) Writing specifies the target position for the `run-to-abs-pos`
and `run-to-rel-pos` commands. Reading returns the current value. Units are
in tacho counts. You can use the value returned by `counts_per_rot` to
convert tacho counts to/from rotations or degrees. The range is
-2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,647 tachometer counts (32-bit signed integer).

`speed`
: (read-only) Returns the current motor speed in tacho counts per second.
Note, this is not necessarily degrees (although it is for LEGO motors).
Use the `count_per_rot` attribute to convert this value to RPM or deg/sec.

`speed_sp`
: (read/write) Writing sets the target speed in tacho counts per second used
for all `run-*` commands except `run-direct`. Reading returns the current
value. A negative value causes the motor to rotate in reverse with the
exception of `run-to-*-pos` commands where the sign is ignored. Use the
`count_per_rot` attribute to convert RPM or deg/sec to tacho counts per
second. Use the `count_per_m` attribute to convert m/s to tacho counts per
second.

`ramp_up_sp`
: (read/write) Writing sets the ramp up setpoint. Reading returns the
current value. Units are in milliseconds and must be positive. When set
to a non-zero value, the motor speed will increase from 0 to 100% of
`max_speed` over the span of this setpoint. The actual ramp time is the
ratio of the difference between the `speed_sp` and the current `speed`
and max_speed multiplied by `ramp_up_sp`.

`ramp_down_sp`
: (read/write) Writing sets the ramp down setpoint. Reading returns the
current value. Units are in milliseconds and must be positive. When set
to a non-zero value, the motor speed will decrease from 0 to 100% of
`max_speed` over the span of this setpoint. The actual ramp time is the
ratio of the difference between the `speed_sp` and the current `speed`
and max_speed multiplied by `ramp_down_sp`.

`speed_pid/Kd`
: (read/write) The derivative constant for the speed regulation PID.

`speed_pid/Ki`
: (read/write) The integral constant for the speed regulation PID.

`speed_pid/Kp`
: (read/write) The proportional constant for the speed regulation PID.

`state`
: (read-only) Reading returns a space separated list of state flags.
Possible flags are:

    - `running`: Power is being sent to the motor.
    - `ramping`: The motor is ramping up or down and has not yet reached a
      constant output level.
    - `holding`: The motor is not turning, but rather attempting to hold a
      fixed position.
    - `overloaded`: The motor is turning, but cannot reach its `speed_sp`.
    - `stalled`: The motor is not turning when it should be.

`stop_action`
: (read/write) Reading returns the current stop action. Writing sets the
stop action. The value determines the motors behavior when `command` is
set to `stop`. Possible values are:

    - `coast`: Removes power from the motor. The motor will freely coast to
       a stop.
    - `brake`: Removes power from the motor and creates a passive electrical
       load. This is usually done by shorting the motor terminals together.
       This load will absorb the energy from the rotation of the motors and
       cause the motor to stop more quickly than coasting.
    - `hold`: Causes the motor to actively try to hold the current position.
       If an external force tries to turn the motor, the motor will "push
       back" to maintain its position.

    Not all actions may be supported. Read `stop_actions` to get the
    actions available for a particular driver.

`stop_actions`
: (read-only) Returns a space-separated list of stop actions supported by the
motor controller.

`time_sp`
: (read/write) Writing specifies the amount of time the motor will run when
using the `run-timed` command. Reading returns the current value. Units
are in milliseconds.
