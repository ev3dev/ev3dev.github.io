title: NXT Analog Sensor Driver
---

The `nxt-analog-sensor` module provides all of the drivers for NXT/Analog
sensors. You can find the complete list [here][supported sensors]. These
drivers scale the analog voltage read from the sensor to a useful value.

### sysfs

You can find the devices bound to this driver in the directory
`/sys/bus/lego/drivers/nxt-analog-sensor`. However, these drivers provide a
[lego-sensor device], which is where all the really useful attributes are.

`driver_names` (read-only)
: Returns a space-separated list of all NXT/Analog sensor driver names.

[lego-sensor device]: ../lego-sensor-class
