The `pistorms` module provides drivers for most of the functionality of the
[mindsensors.com PiStorms][pistorms] including [lego-port] class instances
for the input and output ports, an [evdev] driver (evdev is not to be confused
with ev3dev) for the touchscreen and GO button, a [power_supply] driver for
monitoring the battery and an [leds] driver for the multi-color LEDs.
