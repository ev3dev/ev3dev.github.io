title: EV3/NXT Tacho Motor Driver
---

This driver provides a [tacho-motor] interface for EV3 and NXT motors or any
other compatible motor with an [incremental rotary encoder] for position
and direction feedback that is connected to an output port. We call them
"tacho" motors because that is what the LMS2012 source code calls them. You
can find the devices bound to this driver in the directory
`/sys/bus/lego/drivers/legoev3-motor /`. There is not much of interest
there though - all of the useful stuff is in the [tacho-motor] class.
