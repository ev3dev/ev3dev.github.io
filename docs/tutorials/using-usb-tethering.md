When using tethering, the EV3 brick will act as a network server. This
means there is little to no configuration that needs to be done on your host
computer which makes it easy to setup and use. However, you __cannot access the
Internet from your EV3 using tethering__. If you want to be able to update
packages or do anything else that requires an Internet connection, you will need
to set up another connection instead of or in addition to a tethering connection.
