These instructions are for [brickman v0.7.0](/news/2015/12/15/Package-Release/){: .alert-link} and later.
If you are using an older version, please upgrade.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

*   {: tab="Mac OSX"}{% include /style/icon.html type="warning" %}
    If you are using OS X version 10.11, this may or may not work. Let us know about your
    experience on [Issue #471](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/471){: .alert-link}.
    {: class="alert alert-warning"}

    {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
    These instructions were written using OS X version 10.9, but should work for
    other versions as well.
    {: class="alert alert-info"}

    1.  Use the USB cable provided with the EV3 to connect the EV3 to your Mac.
        On your Mac, open up *System Preferences* and select *Network*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/SystemPreferencesNetwork.png" %}

    2.  Once you get the *Network* dialog, click on the `+` icon in the lower left
        area to add a new network device. You'll need to select the CDC Composite
        Gadget in the drop down box. The name will be similar to what is shown
        below. I have renamed the service "ev3dev" so it's easier to keep track of
        later. Click *Create* when you are done.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/AddNewDevice.png" %}

    3.  Click *Apply* to save your changes. After a short time, the ev3dev entry
        (or whatever you named it) should show connected and have a Self-Assigned
        IP address.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/CDC-Connected.png" %}

    4.  To share our Internet connection with the EV3, go back to *System
        Preferences* and select *Sharing*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/SystemPreferencesSharing.png" %}

    5.  Click *Internet Connection* on the left, but don't check the box yet. On
        the right, *Share your connection from:* will be *Wi-Fi* (or *Ethernet* if
        you have a wired connection). Also check the box next to *CDC Composite
        Gadget*

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/Sharing-Internet-Connection.png" %}

    6.  Now, check the box next to *Internet Connection* on the left to enable it.
        Read the warning and then click *Start*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/osx/10.9/Sharing-Internet-Connection-Warning.png" %}

    7.  Time to switch to the EV3. On the EV3, go to *Wireless and Networks* and
        select *All Network Connections*, then select the *Wired* connection.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-connections-wired-only.png" %}

    9.  The *Status* should change to *Connecting* and then *Online* to indicate
        that you are in fact connected to the Internet. You can also check the
        *Connect automatically* box so that this connection will come up automatically
        in the future.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-online-connect-automatically-selected.png" %}

*   {: tab="Ubuntu"}{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
    These instructions were written using Ubuntu 15.10 and the default desktop
    (aka Unity). However, the instructions should work for other versions of Ubuntu
    and its derivatives as well as other desktops like GNOME Shell, Cinnamon
    and MATE.
    {:class="alert alert-info"}

    1.  On your host computer, with the EV3 connected via USB, open up the
        network application indicator (1). You should already see an entry for
        *LEGO Group EV3+ev3dev* (2). Click *Edit Connections...* (3) to open
        `nm-connection-manager`. If you are using a different desktop environment
        that does not have this menu, you can run `nm-connection-editor` from
        a terminal instead.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/network-application-indicator-edit-connections.png" %}

    2.  In the *Network Connections* dialog, click the *Add...* button.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/network-connections-add.png" %}

    3.  Make sure *Ethernet* is selected (1) and then click *Create...* (2).

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/choose-a-connection-type.png" %}

    4.  Enter a *Connection Name* (1) and select the *Device MAC Address* of your
        EV3 from the list (2). The name can be anything you like. The MAC address
        will always start with `12:16:53`, so choose that one.

        Be sure to delete the network interface name (e.g. `bnep0` or `enp0s20f0u4c2`)
        in (2), leaving only the MAC address. Otherwise, the connection may not work
        if you plug the EV3 into a different USB port later.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/editing-ev3dev-ethernet.png" %}

        {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
        If the MAC address starts with `32:16:53` instead of `12:16:53`, this means
        it is using the wrong USB configuration (technically speaking it is
        trying to use RNDIS instead of CDC, which kind of works but is not as good).
        Unplug your USB cable and plug it back in.
        {: .alert .alert-info}

    5.  Then click on the *IPv4 Settings* tab (1) and change the *Method* to
        *Shared to other computers* (2). Click *Save* (3) when you are done.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/editing-ev3dev-ipv4-settings.png" %}

    6.  There may be a message that the network is connected. Don't believe it.
        We still have to tell the EV3 to connect. You can close the *Network
        Connections* dialog. We are done with it.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/ubuntu/15.10/network-connections-close.png" %}

    7.  Now, we need to assign an IP address to our EV3. In brickman, go to
        *Wireless and Networks* and select *All Network Connections*, then select
        the *Wired* connection with the USB icon.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-connections-wired-only.png" %}

    8.  Then select *Connect*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-disconnected-connect-selected.png" %}

    9.  The *Status* should change to *Connecting* and then *Online* to indicate
        that you are in fact connected to the Internet. You can also check the
        *Connect automatically* box so that this connection will come up automatically
        in the future.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-online-connect-automatically-selected.png" %}

*   {: tab="Windows"}{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
    These instructions were written using Windows 10, but should work on Windows
    7 and 8 as well.
    {:class="alert alert-info"}

    1.  Before connecting the USB cable, go ahead and open *Devices and Printers*
        on your computer. It is in the *Control Panel* under *Hardware and Sound*.
        (Or just type *Devices and Printers* in the start menu.)

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/devices-and-printers.png" %}

    2.  Connect your EV3 to your Windows computer using the USB cable that came
        with the EV3. You should see an unknown device pop up right away.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/devices-and-printers-new-device.png" %}

    3.  Wait a minute for Windows install the driver. It will detect the EV3
        as a *Remote NDIS Compatible Device*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/devices-and-printers-rndis.png" %}

        {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
        PROTIP: You can get an icon that looks like an actual EV3 by installing
        [Programmable Brick Icons](https://github.com/ev3dev/PBrickIcons){: .alert-link}.
        Follow the link for more information.
        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev/PBrickIcons/master/demo1.png" %}
        {:class="alert alert-info"}

    4.  Right-click the *Remote NDIS Compatible Device* and select *Network Settings*.
        This takes you to the *Network and Sharing Center*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/devices-and-printers-context-menu-network-settings.png" %}

    5.  In the *Network and Sharing Center*, make a note of which connection is
        your Internet connection (1) and then click on *Change adapter settings*
        (2). In this example, our Internet connection is **Network 5**.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/network-and-sharing-center-change-adapter-settings.png" %}

    6.  There will be a connection that says *Remote NDIS Compatible Device* (1).
        This is the EV3. Let's rename it so it is easy to identify. Right-click
        the adapter and select *Rename* (2). Call it EV3 or whatever you like.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/network-connections-context-menu-rename.png" %}

    7.  To share our Internet connection with the EV3, double-click the Internet
        network connection that you noted earlier (**not** the one we just
        renamed). This will show the connection status.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/network-connections-internet-adapter.png" %}

    8.  If you have more than one other connection, you will want to verify that
        this connection is indeed the Internet connection (1). Then, click on the
        *Properties* button (2).

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/local-area-connection-status.png" %}

    9.  In the window that opens, select the *Sharing* tab (1) and check the box
        that says *Allow other network users to connect through this computer's
        Internet connection* (2).

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/local-area-connection-properties-sharing.png" %}

        {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
        If you have more than two network connections, it will ask for a "Home
        networking connection". If you see this, select your EV3's network adapter
        from the list (this will be called *EV3* if you renamed it earlier in the
        guide).
        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/8/local-area-connection-properties-sharing-with-extra-selection.png" %}
        {: class="alert alert-info"}

        {% include /style/icon.html type="warning" %}
        Windows Internet Connection Sharing is temperamental. Sometimes it just
        stops working for no reason. If this happens, just turn it off (by unchecking
        *Allow other...* and clicking *OK*) and then turn it back on. It should
        start working again.
        {: class="alert alert-warning"}

    10. Click *OK* when you are done and close the status window as well. Windows
        will automatically reconfigure your other network connections.

    11. Now, we need to do some setting up on the EV3. Go to *Networking* and
        select *Manage connections...*, then select the *Wired* connection.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-connections-wired-only.png" %}

    12. Internet Connection Sharing on Windows is temperamental, so we are going
        to use a static IP address to make it a bit more reliable. Select *IPv4* on the menu.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-disconnected-ipv4-selected.png" %}

    13. Select *Change...*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-disconnected-ipv4-empty.png" %}

    14. Then choose *Load Windows Defaults*.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-load-windows-defaults.png" %}

    15. The settings on the *IPv4* screen will remain blank because we are not
        connected yet. Go back to the previous screen and check the box for
        *Connect automatically*. This way you don't have to connect manually
        after you reboot. Then select *Connect*. *State* should change to
        *Online* to indicate that your EV3 is connected to the Internet.

        {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/wired-status-online-connect-selected.png" %}

Now that you have a network connection, you should
[connect to your EV3 with SSH](/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-ev3dev-with-ssh)
if you haven't done so already.
