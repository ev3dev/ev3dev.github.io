*   {: data-platform-attribute-value-id="ev3"}
    On the EV3, do a thing in this specific way.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value-id="brickpi"}
    The BrickPi is a little different. You actually need to do this other thing.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value-id="pistorms"}
    The PiStorms doesn't support this portion of the functionality.
    You need to take this into consideration.
