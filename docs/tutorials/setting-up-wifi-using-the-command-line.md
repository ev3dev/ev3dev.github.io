You must have another way to connect to your robot first before following this
tutorial. On the EV3, that means USB or Bluetooth. If you have a Raspberry Pi,
you can plug in a monitor and keyboard to the Raspberry Pi. The instructions
below are run on your robot itself.

I like to setup wireless networking on my robots. Robots should go untethered!
Here is how. It's easy in an interactive tool call `connmanctl`. You connect
once, and next time you boot, it's all configured. On my ev3dev machine it went
like this:

    robot@ev3dev:~$ sudo connmanctl
    Error getting VPN connections: The name net.connman.vpn was not provided by any
    connmanctl> enable wifi
    Enabled wifi
    connmanctl> scan wifi

    connmanctl> connect wifi_e8de27077de3_41483034303434393134_managed_psk

    Passphrase? *************
    Connected wifi_e8de27077de3_41483034303434393134_managed_psk
    connmanctl> quit

You're all set up now! After reboot connman automatically finds your local
Wi-Fi again.
