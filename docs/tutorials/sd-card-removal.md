Method 2: Pliers

Grab the card between some small pliers/tweezers.


Method 3: Disassembly

Pull the battery case off the back. Remove the batteries. Undo the 4 screws holding the battery housing to the EV3. The EV3 should now slide apart. You can easily remove the SD card. Make sure no to sever the cable to the LCD or to lose any parts. Now reasemble the EV3.
