Introduction:

You've probably put your SD card into the EV3 by now and successfully booted EV3dev. Now you want to pull the card out and check that the default firmware is still working. You push on the card, expecting it pop out, but it stubbornly remains in your robot. There are a few ways to remove the card from the EV3. The methods of removal are ranked from most reccomended to least reccomended.

IMPORTANT: make sure the EV3 is not turned on when removing the card.

Method 1: Tape

Equipment: Tape

Have a small bit of tape stuck around the sd card. Make sure not to have the tape reach the metal connectors at the end of the card. You can pull on the tape to easily remove the card.

This is probably the best method for getting te card out.


Method 2: Fingers

Equipment: Long fingernails

If you have long enough fingernails you may just be able to pull the card out. 


Method 3: Pliers

Equipment: Pliers

GENTLY grab the card between some small pliers/tweezers. Be very careful and go slow!


Method 4: Disassembly

Equipment: Screwdriver

Pull the battery case off the back. Remove the batteries. Undo the 4 screws holding the battery housing to the EV3. The EV3 should now slide apart. You can easily remove the SD card. Make sure not to sever the cable to the LCD or to lose any parts. Now reasemble the EV3.


Method 5: Mod it!?

Equipment: Saw, Soldiering Iron, New SD card holder, Band-aids

Maybe you could cut away part of the case, or change the SD card holder to a sprung one?
