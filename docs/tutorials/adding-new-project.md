We currently have a [projects page] where you can browse projects that have
been built using ev3dev. You can add your own too!  Each project gets a
dedicated page for the author to explain what they have been working on, as
well as provide videos, pictures, build instructions, code, and any other media
that pertains to the project. This is where we explain how you can submit your
project page to be hosted on the site.

##Overview

All the projects on the website are stored in the [projects folder].
Each post is saved as a Markdown file, and is automagically converted to HTML
when you publish your changes (read more about Kramdown
[here][kramdown basics]). To submit a page,
all you need to do is add a markdown file in that folder and submit a pull
request. We recommend that you start with a copy of the [template project].
You can see the example file live on [the website][template page].

This guide will walk you through submitting a page without the need for any git
experience or local tools installed on your computer. All you need is a
browser.

## Step 1: Making a Copy of the Website Source

The first step to submitting your project is forking the source code on GitHub.
To do this, open a browser and navigate to the [website repository]. Make
sure that you are signed in to your GitHub account, and then click the "fork"
button in the upper-right corner.

It should take a second, but when GitHub finishes processing your request you
should be at a page very similar to where you started, except now you are
looking at your own copy.

##Step 2: Setting Up A Preview (Optional)

If you want to be able to preview your new page before you submit it, and are
willing to add a bit of extra complexity, you have to create a new branch
called `gh-pages`. Adding this branch will let you preview the whole site, so
you can see how your page will look when it is published (which is different
from the markdown preview that you will see on GitHub). To do this, click the
box where it says "branch: master". It should expand to show you a text box.
Type the text `gh-pages` in to the box that appears (make sure that it is
exactly that text; this is important). It should give you the option to create
a new branch; click that button.

Now, you should be able to navigate to
`http://<username>.github.io/ev3dev.github.io` in a new tab to see your copy of
the site. After you complete step 3, visit this preview URL again to make sure
that your page looks as it should.

If you complete this step, note that everywhere it says "`master`" in the
screenshots below, it should say "`gh-pages`" instead.

*WARNING*: If you complete this step, GitHub will send you emails warning you
about the CNAME. You can ignore them; but if they get annoying, see [the readme]
on the official site repo for information on circumventing the problem.

##Step 3: Adding Your Page

Now that you have your own copy the site, it's time to create your page. To
start, use the file list and choose the `projects/_posts` folder. Select the
file called `2014-03-21-Example-Project.md` to open it in the browser.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/Website/Project-template-file-on-GitHub.png" scale="100" %}

GitHub will try to read the file and render it how it thinks it's intended to
be displayed. Although the preview that it shows you probably won't look
exactly like it will on the site, it should give you a pretty good idea.

Click the "Raw" button in the upper-right corner of the page to view the
contents of the file itself.

This file that you have opened is not an actual project. It is a template file
that is meant to be copied to make new project creation easier. The part we
want is everything between the "---"s. This is called "frontmatter," and it
describes everything about a project, such as the author of the project. Select
and copy the frontmatter out of the template file (make sure that you include
the dashes). [This][raw template] is what you should have.

Now use the "back" button of your browser to go back to the posts folder. Click
the "+" button to create a new file.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/Website/Add-file-on-GitHub.png" %}

Give it a name using the format "`YYYY-MM-DD-my-project-name.md`", where
`YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` are the current year, month, and day, and
`my-project-name` is the name of your project, with dashes instead of spaces.
Then paste in the frontmatter that we copied earlier. Fill out as many of the
properties as you can, and delete the lines of the ones you can't fill out.
After the second set of dashes ('---'), you can type your description text,
which is parsed as [Kramdown][kramdown basics] on the site.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/Website/Creating-file-on-GitHub.png" scale="100" %}

Once you are happy with the content of your new page, click the "Commit new
file" button to save your changes. This is when you should go and preview your
page if you created a `gh-pages` branch earlier.


##Step 4: Submitting Your Changes

Now that you have made your changes to your copy of the site, you need to
submit your changes for review.

Open a browser and navigate back to
`https://github.com/<username>/ev3dev.github.io`.

If you followed step 3, you will need to switch to the `gh-pages` branch that
you created earlier using the same box in the upper-left corner. Click it and
select "gh-pages."

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/Website/Switching-branches-on-GitHub.png" scale="50" %}

Now click the green "Compare, review and pull request" button.

<img src="https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/pull_requests/pull-request-start-review-button.png" style="max-width: 300px;" />

Then click "Create pull request," and enter a title and brief description of
your new page before clicking the button that says "Create pull request" again
to submit your changes.

The project maintainers will be notified automatically that you have submitted
edits, and will review and merge your changes when they get the chance.
