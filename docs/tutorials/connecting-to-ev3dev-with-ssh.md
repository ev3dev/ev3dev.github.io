title: Connecting to Ev3dev Using SSH
group: basic-networking
---

Connecting with SSH will allow you to run commands on the EV3 over the network
so that you can deploy code, change settings, and install tools. Make sure that
you have configured a network connection before continuing.

*   {: tab="Mac OSX"}
    OS X supports the good old `ssh` program. In a terminal, run the following command
    to use it to connect to your EV3 or other ev3dev device.

        ssh robot@ev3dev.local

    <div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">
    {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
    If you have never connected before, you will be prompted to confirm the
    authenticity of the host, so type <code>yes</code> when prompted.
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <pre>
        The authenticity of host 'ev3dev.local (192.168.2.3)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

        robot@ev3dev:~$ 


*   {: tab="Windows"}
    To connect via SSH on Windows, you will need a program called [PuTTY].
    Download and run it from [their download page][PuTTY download]. In the
    *PuTTY Configuration* window, type in `ev3dev` for the "host name".
    Then click the *Open* button to connect.

    {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/putty-configuration-ev3dev.png" %}

    <div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">

    {% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
    The first time you connect, you'll get a warning about the new fingerprint.
    This is normal. Just click *Yes* to continue. You won't see this again
    unless you re-flash your SD card.

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/putty-security-alert.png" %}
    </div>
    </div>

    Once you are connected, type in the ev3dev username (`robot`) and the password
    (`maker` if you haven't changed it yet) and then you should be logged in.

    {% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/windows/10/putty-robot-at-ev3dev.png" %}

    {% include /style/icon.html type="success" %}
    Pro tip! You can copy text by selecting it (dragging accross it with your cursor)
    and paste by right-clicking on the PuTTY window.
