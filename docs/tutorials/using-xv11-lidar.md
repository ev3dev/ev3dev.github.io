## Interfacing the LIDAR

XV11 LIDAR communicates using UART, 8N1 at 3.3V with baud rate 115200.

EV3 has all the required hardware to communicate with the LIDAR and ev3dev has the software.

{% include icon.html type="warning" %}
The instructions on this page apply to EV3.
You can also get it working with Raspberry PI and BrickPI but BrickPI doesn't support
other-uart mode for sensor port and dedicated Raspberry Pi UART GPIO pins are already taken by BrickPI.
You have to figure out some other way to get the UART. USB to UART bridge could be one option.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

To interface the LIDAR one has to:

1. Solder the connector for LIDAR motor
2. Solder the connector for LIDAR data and power
3. Put the EV3 input port in other-uart mode
4. Put the EV3 output port in dc-motor mode
4. Spin the LIDAR motor CCW with speed around 300 RPM
5. Read LIDAR data using UART 

For the details, follow video tutorial:

Use the simplified 2-wire way of soldering the motor connector. No resistors needed. See below.

## Motor Connector

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include icon.html type="info" %}
In previous versions of this tutorial there was a scheme with resistors for auto-detection.
Currently the recommended way is to just solder the two wires and load the dc-motor driver manually.
In fact you should load the dc-motor driver manually also if you have soldered the resistors.

## Data and Power Connector

## Sensor Port Mode

I am assuming your data connector is connected to `port 1` (adjust commands otherwise).

You will have to put the sensor port in `other-uart` mode:

    echo other-uart > /sys/class/lego-port/port0/mode
	
You can read and write to or from LIDAR at:

    /dev/tty_in1
	
It is binary tty communication. More information in `Testing the LIDAR` section.
	
## Motor Port Mode
	
I am assuming your motor connector is connected to `port A` and it is the only motor.	

First, you have to put the motor port in `dc-motor` mode:

    echo dc-motor > /sys/class/lego-port/port4/mode
	
Then your motor interface will be available at:

    /sys/class/dc-motor/motor0
		 
## LIDAR Rotational Geometry

If you assume that XV11 LIDAR returns you the distance to the object you will have it *almost* right. To do it correctly take into account the rotational geometry of the LIDAR.

The scheme below is for Revo LDS. For XV11 it is enough to change some signs. See [xv11test] for detailed formulas.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/xv11-tutorial/lidar_rotational_geometry.png" caption="Revo LDS rotational geometry"%}

You may ignore the above and the reported distance will still be approximately correct. 
You will introduce systematic error, dependent on angle, bounded by 25 mm on x and y.
Regardless, the LIDAR has also random error with variance dependent on distance, surface and reflection angle.

## Testing the LIDAR

You can use [xv11test] from the github repository to:

- test the LIDAR
- plot the LIDAR scan 
- get idea how to communicate with the LIDAR
- get idea how to interpret the LIDAR output and apply geometric correction
- use `xv11lidar.h` and `xv11lidar.c` as a simple C library to communicate with the LIDAR
- run `xv11test` with `-raw` argument and pipe LIDAR data to your program (C, C# and Java examples included)

Go to repository and follow readme.md instructions.

## Mechanical Integration

At some point you will want to install the LIDAR on the robot. You can make inexpensive stand compatible with LEGO from polycarbonate, acrylic plastic or even wood.
I choose polycarbonate. Make a plate 120 mm x 104 mm (this corresponds to 15 and 13 thick technic beams). I did it a bit too thick - 8 mm but if you connect it to your construction from only one side this doesn't matter.
Order same spacers (25 mm high for M3 screws are ok). Drill the holes for spacers and technic pins. My XV11 LIDAR plate below was meant as first experiment but ended right in the robot. A lot of technic pin holes are out of place but there were just enough made right to fix the plate to the robot.

Everything for just a few â‚¬ or $.

## Laser Specs and Safety

You can find laser technical parameters on Neato website - see [laser specs], the `Compliance information` section.
According to this documentation the laser is class 1 device. It means that it is safe under all conditions of normal use.
Whether our use is normal is disputable. See wikipedia entry on [laser safety class 1] if you are concerned.

Despite some contrary information on the internet the XV11 laser is in the visible range of light.
It is possible to see the laser dot if looking at exactly correct angle.
The laser pulse duration is only 200 microseconds so you would see a blinking dot on every revolution.

Quite obviously I am not encouraging you to do that and if you do, you're doing it at own risk.
