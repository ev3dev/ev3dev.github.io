## Interfacing the LIDAR

XV11 LIDAR communicates using UART, 8N1 at 3.3V with baud rate 115200.

EV3 has all the required hardware to communicate with the LIDAR and ev3dev has the software.

{% include /style/icon.html type="warning" %}
The instructions on this page apply to EV3.
You can also get it working with Raspberry PI and BrickPI but BrickPI doesn't support
other-uart mode for sensor port and dedicated Raspberry Pi UART GPIO pins are already taken by BrickPI.
You have to figure out some other way to get the UART. USB to UART bridge could be one option.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

To interface the LIDAR one has to:

1. Solder the connector for LIDAR motor
2. Solder the connector for LIDAR data and power
3. Put the EV3 output port in dc-motor mode
4. Put the EV3 input port in other-uart mode
5. Spin the LIDAR motor CCW with speed around 300 RPM
6. Read LIDAR data using UART 

For the details, follow video tutorial:
<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
Use the simplified 2-wire way of soldering the motor connector. No resistors needed. See below.
</div>

{% include /util/youtube-embed.html youtube_video_id="G6uVg34VzHw" %}

## Motor Connector

You will need half of EV3 cable, header mating [JST PH 2.0mm pitch] connector with 2 pins and heat shrink tubes.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
With the above scheme use positive duty cycle to drive the motor counterclockwise.
</div>
	
## Data and Power Connector

You will need half of EV3 cable, half of USB cable, header mating [JST PH 2.0mm pitch] connector with 4 pins and heat shrink tubes.

{% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/xv11-tutorial/lidar_data_scheme.png" caption="LIDAR data connector scheme" %}

{% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/xv11-tutorial/lidar_data_photo.jpg" caption="1 - materials 2 - cut the cables 3 - strip wire 4 - solder grounds 5 - solder connector 6 - heat shrink tubing 7 - the connector 8 - connected" %}

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
The USB power connector is also reference potential for the UART lines.
Plug USB power connector to EV3 or passive (non-powered) USB hub connected to EV3.
LIDAR consumes around 135 mA from USB. EV3 has enough power to supply 2 LIDARS and reasonable Wi-Fi dongle.
</div>

## Motor Port Mode

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="warning" %}
LIDAR should be spinning counterclockwise at around 200-300 RPM. With the wiring from this tutorial use positive duty cycle around 45 to spin counterclockwise at around 300 RPM.
</div>
	
I am assuming your motor connector is connected to `port A` and it is the only motor.	

First, you have to put the motor port in `dc-motor` mode:

    echo dc-motor > /sys/class/lego-port/port4/mode
	
Then your motor interface will be available at:

    /sys/class/dc-motor/motor0


## Sensor Port Mode

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="warning" %}
Plug USB power connector to EV3 or passive (non-powered) USB hub connected to EV3, not to other device.
The USB power connector is also reference potential for the UART lines.
</div>

I am assuming your data connector is connected to `port 1` (adjust commands otherwise).

You will have to put the sensor port in `other-uart` mode:

    echo other-uart > /sys/class/lego-port/port0/mode
	
You can read and write to or from LIDAR at:

    /dev/tty_in1
	
It is binary tty communication. More information in `Testing the LIDAR` section.
			 
## LIDAR Rotational Geometry

If you assume that XV11 LIDAR returns you the distance to the object you will have it *almost* right. To do it correctly take into account the rotational geometry of the LIDAR.

The scheme below is for Revo LDS. For XV11 it is enough to change some signs. See [xv11lidar-test] for detailed formulas.

{% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/xv11-tutorial/lidar_rotational_geometry.png" caption="Revo LDS rotational geometry"%}

You may ignore the above and the reported distance will still be approximately correct. 
You will introduce systematic error, dependent on angle, bounded by 25 mm on x and y.
Regardless, the LIDAR has also random error with variance dependent on distance, surface and reflection angle.

## Testing the LIDAR

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
If your EV3 connects using Wi-Fi adapter you need passive (non-powered) USB hub to power the laser and Wi-Fi.
LIDAR power has to be drawn from EV3 (or USB hub connected to EV3) in order to have the right UART reference potential.
</div>

Interested to see LIDAR output in realtime? Follow `ev3dev-mapping`

Interested in LIDAR geometry and internals? Follow `xv11test`

### xv11test

You can use xv11test from the github repository to:

- test the LIDAR
- plot the LIDAR scan 
- get idea how to interpret the LIDAR output and apply geometric correction

Follow readme.md in [xv11lidar-test] repository.

### ev3dev-mapping

Plot the readings in real-time with [ev3dev-mapping]

Get [Unity] on your PC. While it's installing:

- on EV3 follow Building Instructions at [ev3dev-mapping-modules]
- on PC follow Installation Instructions at [ev3dev-mapping-ui]

On EV3 plug LIDAR data connector to `port 1`, LIDAR power connector to USB, motor connector to `port C` and:

``` bash
cd ev3dev-mapping-modules/bin
./TestingTheLIDAR.sh # put in/out ports to other-uart/dc-motor modes
./ev3control 8004 500 # start ev3control with UDP port and timeout
``` 

On PC open ev3dev-mapping-ui in Unity and follow the steps below:

{% include /util/screenshot.html source="/images/xv11-tutorial/testing_lidar_with_mapping.png" caption="ev3dev-mapping-ui - 1 - open the scene 2 - select Robot object 3 - set IP addresses 4 - hit play"%}

## Libraries

[xv11lidar] is a simple low-level C library with just 3 functions - `InitLaser`, `ReadLaser` and `CloseLaser`.

Library takes care of LIDAR communication and you can handle the motor with one of [ev3dev libraries] or shell script.

## Mechanical Integration

At some point you will want to install the LIDAR on the robot. You can make inexpensive stand compatible with LEGO from polycarbonate, acrylic plastic or even wood.
I choose polycarbonate. Make a plate 120 mm x 104 mm (this corresponds to 15 and 13 thick technic beams). I did it a bit too thick - 8 mm but if you connect it to your construction from only one side this doesn't matter.
Order same spacers (25 mm high for M3 screws are ok). Drill the holes for spacers and technic pins. My XV11 LIDAR plate below was meant as first experiment but ended right in the robot. A lot of technic pin holes are out of place but there were just enough made right to fix the plate to the robot.

Everything for just a few â‚¬ or $.

## Laser Specs and Safety

You can find laser technical parameters on Neato website - see [laser specs], the `Compliance information` section.
According to this documentation the laser is class 1 device. It means that it is safe under all conditions of normal use.
Whether our use is normal is disputable. See wikipedia entry on [laser safety class 1] if you are concerned.

Despite some contrary information on the internet the XV11 laser is in the visible range of light.
It is possible to see the laser dot if looking at exactly correct angle.
The laser pulse duration is only 200 microseconds so you would see a blinking dot on every revolution.

Quite obviously I am not encouraging you to do that and if you do, you're doing it at own risk.
