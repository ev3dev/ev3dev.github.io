These instructions are for [brickman v0.5.0](http://www.ev3dev.org/news/2015/02/24/Package-Release/).
If you are using an older version, please upgrade.

1.  On the EV3, first verify that Bluetooth is powered on. In brickman,
    open the *Wireless and Networks* menu and select *Bluetooth*. Make sure the
    *Powered* checkbox is checked. The Bluetooth icon next to the battery in the
    status bar also indicates that Bluetooth is powered on.
