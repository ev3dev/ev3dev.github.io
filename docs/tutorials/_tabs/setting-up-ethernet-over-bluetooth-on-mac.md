1.  On the EV3, first verify that Bluetooth is powered on. In brickman,
    open the *Wireless and Networks* menu and select *Bluetooth*. Make sure the
    *Powered* checkbox is checked. The Bluetooth icon next to the battery in the
    status bar also indicates that Bluetooth is powered on.

2.  On your host computer, open *System Preferences* and go to *Bluetooth*. This
    will make your host computer discoverable.

3.  On the EV3, select *Start Scan* on the *Bluetooth* menu. It should find your
    computer.

4.  Select your computer from the menu and then select the *Pair* button.

5.  Confirm the passkey on both devices when requested.

6.  On your Mac, open up *System Preferences* and select *Network*.

7.  If you do not already have a Bluetooth PAN device, click on the `+`
    icon in the lower left area to add a new network device. You'll need to
    select *Bluetooth PAN* in the drop down box. Click *Create* when you are done.

8.  You should see your EV3 listed next to *Device:*. Click *Apply* to save your
    changes, but don't connect yet. In fact, don't try to use the *Connect*
    button you see here. It is for [tethering] and won't work for the connection
    we are setting up here. Instead, we will initiate the connection from the
    EV3 itself later.

9.  To share our Internet connection with the EV3. Go back to *System
    Preferences* and select *Sharing*.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/OSXRNDIS/SystemPreferencesSharing.png" %}

    Click *Internet Connection* on the left, but don't check the box yet. On
    the right, *Share your connection from:* will be *Wi-Fi* (or *Ethernet* if
    you have a wired connection). Then check the box next to *Bluetooth PAN*

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/Mac-OS-X/Bluetooth/System-Preferences-Sharing-Bluetooth-PAN.png" %}

    Now check the box next to *Internet Connection* on the left to enable it.
    Read the warning and then click *Start*.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/OSXRNDIS/Sharing-Internet-Connection-Warning.png" %}

10. Back on the EV3, you should have a *Network Connection* button. Select it to
    open the network connection settings. (You can also find the connection
    in *Wireless and Networks > All Network Connections*.)

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/bluetooth-device-network-connection.png" %}

    On the *IPv4* tab, select *Change...*.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-ipv4-tab-change-selected.png" %}

    Then choose *Load Mac Defaults*.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-load-mac-defaults.png" %}

    The settings on the *IPv4* tab will remain blank because we are not
    connected yet. On the *Conn.* tab, check the box for *Connect automatically*.
    This way you don't have to connect manually after you reboot.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-connect-automatically-selected.png" %}

    Then select *Connect*. *State* should change to *Online*. Go back to
    the *IPv4* tab. It will show the IP address of your EV3.

    {% include screenshot.html source="/images/brickman/networking-ipv4-tab-with-mac-defaults.png" %}

11. For `ssh` access to the EV3 under OS X, you can use the good old `ssh`
    program from the terminal window. I'm sure there are other solutions, and
    if you send me your suggestions I'll add them to a list.

    In a terminal, run the following command.

        host:~ user$ ssh root@192.168.2.3

    If you have never connected before, you will prompted to confirm the
    authenticity of the host, so type `yes` when prompted.

        The authenticity of host '192.168.2.3 (192.168.2.3)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
        Warning: Permanently added '192.168.2.3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

    The default root password is `r00tme`.
