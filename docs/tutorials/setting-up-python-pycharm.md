This tutorial shows how to set up a nice working environment for developing
Python programs on ev3dev using the PyCharm IDE.
{:.lead}

For this tutorial, we will assume you have flashed an SD card, booted from it, and
[configured networking on your device][network]. These steps are explained in the
[Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started).

## Log in to ev3dev

We'll need to be able to run terminal commands on the EV3 for this guide. To set
this up, head over to our [SSH tutorial](/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-ev3dev-with-ssh/).

## Configure code synchronization

{% include icon.html type="info" %}
The first half of this tutorial assumes you are using the free version of PyCharm.
However, if you have access to the Professional Version of PyCharm, which is free for students
and some open-source projects, you should probably read the PyCharm Professional version
alternatives shown later.
{:.alert .alert-info}

The goal is to be able to transfer code as you write it to the EV3 or other
ev3dev device with as few clicks as possible. To do this, we are going to be
using a program called git. Git is a "version control" system generally used to
store source code. However, it works well for us as an easy way to transfer code
to a remote machine with tools built into PyCharm.

### Configuring a host repo on the ev3dev device

To get started, open the SSH terminal that you set up previously and run the
following commands (make sure to replace the name/email with your own):

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Now let's make a new project using our versioning system. Just type:

    mkdir myproject.git
    git init --bare myproject.git
    mkdir myproject

{% include icon.html type="info" %}
If you'd like to call your project something different, you can replace
instances of `myproject` with your own name. Make sure it doesn't contain spaces
or other special characters.
{:.alert .alert-info}

Yay! Git is initialized in the new folder we created. We have a new project
repository. Now we can clone this repository on our development machine, but
first we need to do a little more configuring, to automatically deploy our
code when we push it back to the ev3dev brick.

    nano myproject.git/hooks/post-receive

Add the following lines to the file you just opened. If you need some tips on
using nano, check out our [nano cheat sheet](/docs/tutorials/nano-cheat-sheet).

    #!/bin/sh
    git --work-tree=/home/robot/myproject --git-dir=/home/robot/myproject.git checkout -f

Finally, do:

    chmod +x myproject.git/hooks/post-receive

### Configuring synchronization in PyCharm

This tutorial focuses on PyCharm Community Edition (although these instructions
also work for more advanced versions of the software). If you haven't already,
install [PyCharm](pycharm).

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/PyCharm/welcome.png" %}

What we are going to do now is make a clone of the project that we created on
the ev3dev machine so we can work on it on the development PC. In the Welcome
dialog of PyCharm, choose: _Checkout from version control_ > _Git_.
Now type the hostname of the ev3dev machine (which is usually going to be
`ev3dev` or `ev3dev.local`), followed by a colon and then the project name. In
the other fields choose a nice parent and project directory.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/PyCharm/clone-repo.png" %}

If all goes well you should end up with a new PyCharm window open to your new
empty project. If the 'testing' dialog stays on screen for a long time, it might
be that your PyCharm master password is needed for your PyCharm password storage.
Cancel the checkout, type the master password and try again.

### Adding some code

Let's add some code to this project. Right-click on the 'myproject' folder in
the left column and choose _new_ > _python file_. Name it `run_motor`. PyCharm
will ask if you want to add it to git; we're using git to synchronize code to
the brick, so we want this enabled. Choose _Yes_.

Now add the following test code:

{% highlight python %}
from ev3dev.auto import *
import time

m = Motor(OUTPUT_A)
m.run_timed(time_sp=3000, speed_sp=500)
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have entered that code, choose _VCS_ > _Commit Changes..._ or press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on Mac).

The commit message is intended to be used to describe the changes you made to your code. That's
handy later on when you begin making lots of changes, but for now you can just type `first commit`.
Now mouse over the commit button and choose "commit and push" from the dropdown.
In the next dialog make sure to select the "alternative branch" checkbox
and click "Push". Voila! Our code has been sent to the ev3dev brick. Let's take
a look.

## Running the code

It's time to run the code we wrote earlier. It tries to run a motor, so plug one
into port A on your brick. Now you'll need to open the SSH session you have from
earlier (or a new one) and run the following commands:

    cd myproject
    python3 run_motor.py

Watch the motor that you attached. If your code runs properly, you should see
the motor spin for three seconds.

## Enabling autocomplete and error checking

While saving the code we used earlier, you may have noticed a problem: PyCharm
puts red curly lines under the ev3dev library's import line.

{% include screenshot.html source="/images/PyCharm/missing-lib.png" %}

This is because the ev3dev library is missing on the development machine and as
a result PyCharm believes your code is referencing nonexistent classes. We can
fix this issue by installing the ev3dev library on the development PC: we won't
be able to run motors on the desktop of course, but the documentation and
autocomplete will be detected in the library so that PyCharm can help you out.

On your host computer install the ev3dev-python library using Python's built-in package manager [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)).

    pip install python-ev3dev

## Using the power of the IDE

With the IDE (PyCharm) set up and the library installed you can code much
faster. PyCharm will highlight most coding errors and typos. It will also
suggest to autocomplete your code and show documentation. You can start
typing `m.` and pycharm will suggest all possible methods and properties.
Choose one. Now you can put your cursor inside the property and press F1 to
see the docs. Or press cmd/control-down arrow to look inside the library where this
property is defined. Neat, huh? Happy coding.

## Additional features for the PyCharm Professional version

The Professional version of PyCharm (which can be obtained for free for
educational institutions and top contributors to open-source projects) has a few
more features to make your development experience much smoother. If you are a
student or teacher, register your valid institutional email address on the
[JetBrains student application page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to
apply for the free version of PyCharm professional. If you are an open source
developer who contributes heavily to an existing project, you can visit the
[JetBrains Open Source license page](https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/)
to see if you qualify for a free version of PyCharm professional.

Here is a list of the tools you can use with PyCharm professional to make your
Python development easier.

| Tool                                     | Purpose
| ---------------------------------------- | -------
| [SFTP Remote Server][remote-server]      | An alternative to the approach used above to transfer files from your host computer to the EV3 pretty instantly when the file is saved on your host computer.
| [SSH Terminal][pycharm-ssh]              | Lets you make the SSH connection directly within PyCharm instead of using a separate tool (like PuTTY).
| [Remote Interpreter][remote-interpreter] | Let's you avoid needing an SSH terminal since you just hit play within PyCharm to run programs. Allows debugging, logs, etc. all within your host computer PyCharm IDE (but it can be SLOW!)

With these tools and installing ev3dev-lang-python on your host computer, you
can really make the Python development process pretty user friendly. 

### Setting up an SFTP Remote Server

This is an alternative to the git post-receive hook solution that was shown
earlier in this tutorial. If you have access to the Professional version of
PyCharm, then this solution is a bit more elegant than the solution shown
earlier. It works about the same in that it instantly transfers files, but it
also allows you to have some other git remote (say GitHub) instead of using the
EV3 as your git remote. Here are the steps necessary to set up your file
transfer mechanism using a PyCharm Remote Server.

- Within PyCharm choose _File_ > _Settings_ for Windows and Linux (or _PyCharm_ > _Preferences_ for OS X)
- Expand Build, Execution, Deployment
- Click Deployment
- Click the + icon to add a new remote server, name it whatever you like (`EV3` for example)
- Select SFTP, then set the following parameters:
  - SFTP host: `ev3dev.local` (or other name if renamed or use the IP address)
  - Port: 22 (don't change it)
  - Root path: / (don't bother change it as we'll set the full path later)
  - User name: `robot`
  - Password: `maker` (this is the default password; if you have changed it, use your own)
  - Save password: Check the box to make it easier on yourself.
- Click the Mappings tab (if blank, hit OK the come back to this spot, sometimes it requires you to save it first)
  - Select the path for your files on the EV3, for example:
    - Deployment path on server: `/home/robot/myfolderpath`
  - Click the button at the top that says `Use this server as default`
  - Hit OK
- Reopen the _File_ > _Settings_ for Windows and Linux (or _PyCharm_ > _Preferences_ for OS X) area  (note we had to save the earlier step first)
- Expand _Build, Execution, Deployment_, expand _Deployment_, then select _Options_
- For `Upload changed files automatically to the default server`, select `On explicit save action`
  
You can test this setup without executing any code. Just make a change, save the
file, and see if the file is in sync on your EV3. Note, in order to run that
test you need an SSH terminal, which you can also do from within PyCharm (see
next instruction).

### Setting up an SSH Terminal within PyCharm

This tool is really just a convenience. Instead of using a separate program,
like PuTTY, MobaXterm, or a Mac Terminal, just do it from within PyCharm. To
start an SSH session just use the menu option _Tools_ > _Start SSH Session..._

It should prompt you for what remote server you want to use and then open an SSH connection to your EV3 in a new tab. Assuming you have completed the step above, you will see your already configured remote all ready to go. You can even skip that selection step by setting the default Deployment server.
- Choose _File_ > _Settings_ for Windows and Linux (or _PyCharm_ > _Preferences_ for OS X)
- Expand Tools
- Select SSH Terminal
- Change Deployment server from `Select server on every run` to your configured server (for example `EV3` if you named it that)

### Setting up a Remote Interpreter

This step is optional. You already have an SSH terminal in PyCharm to run your
program. However wouldn't it be nice to just be able to hit the PyCharm run
button instead of typing `python3 filename.py` in the SSH terminal? It'd feel
like the program was just running on your own computer. This is, theoretically,
possible in Pycharm; however, it has some serious issues.

{% include icon.html type="danger" %}
In my testing, on a real EV3, this approach was so slow it was unusable (perhaps
an RPi would work better). You can try it out. Maybe you'll have better luck.
{:.alert .alert-danger}


- Choose _File_ > _Settings_ for Windows and Linux (or _PyCharm_ > _Preferences_ for OS X)
- Expand your project
- Select `Python Interpreter`
- Click the three little dots to add a new interpreter and select Add Remote
- Select SSH Credentials
- Add the host, username, and password just like you did for the Remote Server setup steps above
- Change the Python interpreter path to `/usr/bin/python3`

Once set up, PyCharm will install some helper info to the ev3, and will index
the existing files on the ev3 which takes a long time (2-3 minutes), so you can
do something else for a little while. When it's done you can use the PyCharm IDE
play button to run your code on ev3. It's a pretty slick idea if it worked
better. Good luck!
