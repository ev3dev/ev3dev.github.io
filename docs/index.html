            <a href="https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/153#issuecomment-93602107">Some pages</a>
            have not been migrated from our old wiki yet. We'd love some help
            with getting these last few pages migrated! If you would like to
            help out, read more about what's needed in the
            <a href="../contribute#write-some-documentation">documentation section</a>
            of our "contributing" page.

<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>
    If you're looking to set up a new installation of ev3dev, check out
    our <a href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> guide.
</p>

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>
    We have a page of tutorials which cover a wide range of topics, from
    networking to specialized hardware configuration. Head over to our
    <a href="/docs/tutorials">Tutorials page</a> to see the full list.
</p>

<h2>Writing some software</h2>
<p>
    To take advantage of ev3dev's main functionality, you'll probably want to
    use a pre-built library from <a href="/docs/programming-languages">our central list of
    programming languages with supported libraries</a>. Choose a language to
    get started!
</p>

<h2>Hardware drivers</h2>
<p>
     If you need to directly program against the ev3dev driver APIs, you can
     check out our <a href="/docs/driver-overview">hardware driver
     documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Developing the ev3dev kernel</h2>
<p>
    In an effort to make it as easy as possible for community members to help out with core software
    development, we have assembled a <a href="kernel-hackers-notebook">kernel hacker's notebook</a>
    that contains information about the EV3 hardware, important devices, and the operating system itself.
    If you are interested in working with the ev3dev source code, you'll also need to know how to
    use our set of <a href="devtools">ev3dev Developer Tools</a>.
