subtitle: Control ev3dev devices from code
excerpt: "If you are looking to write a program that takes advantage of motors, sensors, or other native devices, using a language binding is the way to go. These are the best options for each language."

Before you can start writing code that runs on ev3dev, you need to choose a
programming language. Community members have built libraries that let you use
features such as motors and sensors from your code. Choose the language you want
from below and follow the link to the library's homepage get started.


<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
{% include /style/icon.html type="info" %}
If the language you want isn't listed, you still can use it, but you'll have to
do more of the heavy lifting yourself. You can look at the [driver overview page](/docs/driver-overview/){: .alert-link }
for information on the interfaces you need to use to control devices. Once you get the
hang of it, you can even write your own interface library and have it listed on
the programming languages page!

## Python
<https://github.com/rhempel/ev3dev-lang-python>

Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted scripting language. It is
great for beginners, while also powerful for experienced coders. If you are new
to programming and unsure which language to choose, Python is a great choice!

If you are just starting programming ev3dev, take a look at 
[ev3python.com](http://ev3python.com) by @ndward. The site is intended to help
users of the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 to begin using the ev3dev Python programming
language to control their robot. 

**Warning!** There is another Python library named `python-ev3` created by
@topikachu which is _not_ the same as this one. When searching for documentation
online, make sure that you are reading about @rhempel's `ev3dev-lang-python`.

## JavaScript
<https://github.com/wasabifan/ev3dev-lang-js>

JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web. With a program called Node.js,
you can write JavaScript that can be run locally like any other scripting
language. JavaScript with Node.js is great for writing web servers and other
asynchronous programs which don't need to run tight loops or precise timers. It
has a syntax similar to that of C and related languages, and is relatively easy
to learn.

## Go
<https://github.com/ev3go/ev3dev>

Go is a compiled, statically-typed language created at Google. It aims to be
simple and light while still providing modern language features. While it is a
compiled language, it has its own built-in cross-compiler, which means that you
don't need to spend time setting up special tooling like you do with most other
compiled languages.

## C++
<https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp>

C++ is a low-level, compiled language which is highly performant while still
providing modern language features. It is best for applications which require
the fastest execution or interaction with existing C++ libraries.

## C
<https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c>

C is a low-level, compiled language which is useful for interacting with other
C-based code. It is very lightweight and often the most portable across platforms.

## Vala, Genie and other GObject-based languages with ev3devKit
<https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3devKit>

Through [GObject-introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection),
this library can be used by languages including Vala and Genie, among
[many others](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/Users). This
is great for people who want to use higher-level syntax while still producing a
performant application, or people who want a less error-prone API for C. The
[Brick Manager][https://github.com/ev3dev/brickman] for ev3dev is written using
this library.

# Alternative implementations and wrappers

Some of the libraries above also implement interfaces for other languages. If
you're looking for an alternative implementation for any reason, try out the
options below.

## Python, Ruby and Perl with ev3dev-c
<https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c>

ev3dev-c also has wrappers for [Python](https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c/tree/master/python),
[Ruby](https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c/tree/master/ruby) and [Perl](https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c/tree/master/perl). 

## Python with ev3devKit
<https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3devKit>

Ev3devKit also has a Python wrapper. You can find demos of using ev3devKit from
Python [here](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3devKit/tree/ev3dev-jessie/demo/python).

# Out-of-date, abandoned and unfinished implementations

{% include /style/begin-panel.html type="danger" heading="Listings below this point are for libraries that are not up-to-date, have been abandoned, or are unfinished." %}

Use them with caution, as some functionality will likely be broken. If you
see a library below that you'd like to see in a better state, consider
contributing to it to get it updated and ready to use.
